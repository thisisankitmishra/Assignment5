        "Answer:\n",
        "Multithreading means running multiple threads (smaller parts of one process) at the same time. All threads share the same memory, so they can communicate easily but are limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
        "Multiprocessing runs multiple processes at once. Each process has its own memory and can use different CPU cores, making it faster for CPU-heavy tasks.\n",
